First real commit 

This is the Telepathy-KDE file transfer handler

WARNING: At the moment it just works for incoming file transfers and will
         overwrite any file in the $HOME/Download directory which has the same
         name as the file that you are receiving, so please ensure that you
         don't have any valuable file there.

You can modify the download directory by adding in your
.kde/share/config/ktelepathyrc file in the section [File Transfers] the
variable downloadDirectory

[File Transfers]
downloadDirectory=<download path>
