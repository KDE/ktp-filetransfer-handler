This is the Telepathy-KDE file transfer handler

It basically does 2 thigs
 * Send files to your contact
 * Receive files from your contact

It doesn't set any filter on the mime type, therefore, it should catch all the
file transfer channels that aren't received by any other handler filtering
on mimetype.


To compile it you will need at least Telepathy-Qt4 >= 0.7.1 or the latest
git version.



WARNING: At the moment it just works for incoming file transfers and will
         overwrite any file in the $HOME/Download directory which has the same
         name as the file that you are receiving, so please ensure that you
         don't have any valuable file there.

You can modify the download directory by adding in your
.kde/share/config/ktelepathyrc file in the section [File Transfers] the
variable downloadDirectory

[File Transfers]
downloadDirectory=<download path>
