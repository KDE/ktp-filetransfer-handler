This is the Telepathy-KDE file transfer handler

It basically does 2 thigs
 * Send files to your contact
 * Receive files from your contact

It doesn't set any filter on the mime type, therefore, it should catch all the
file transfer channels that aren't received by any other handler filtering
on mimetype.


To compile it you will need at least Telepathy-Qt4 >= 0.7.3 or the latest
git version.


You can modify the default download directory from telepathy-kded-module or by
adding in your .kde/share/config/ktelepathyrc file in the section
[File Transfers] the variable downloadDirectory

[File Transfers]
downloadDirectory=<download path>
